### PyQuil

**List three aspects of quantum programming in PyQuil that turned out to be easy to learn and list three aspects that were difficult to learn.**

Aspects easy to learn were:
1. It's extremely easy to build and test quantum circuits. 
2. Integrates very well with existing popular Python libraries like Numpy. 
3. Because it's a Python library, it's easy to combine the classical and quantum computations in one code. 

Aspects difficult to learn were:
1. 

**List three aspects of quantum programming in PyQuil that the language supports well and list three aspects that PyQuil supports poorly.**

Three aspects that it supports well:
1. 

**Which feature would you like PyQuil to support to make the quantum programming easier?**

It would be nice to see PyQuil support data visualization features after n number of trials have been run. For these homeworks,
we wrote our own code to help plot the success rate and execution time for various inputs but it would be helpful for future 
developers to have an inbuilt PyQuil function to do that. 

**List three positives and three negatives of the documentation of PyQuil.**

Positives:
1. It was clear and concise.
2. Gave step by step instructions on how to setup the virtual environment. 
3. Gave an indepth API reference to help understand the different parameters the API functions require and what
the default values were set to. 

I can't think of any negatives on the documentation. I think it is very well written. 

**In some cases, PyQuil has its own names for key concepts in quantum programming.  Give a dictionary that maps key concepts in quantum programming to the names used in PyQuil.**



**How much type checking does the PyQuil implementation do at run time when a program passes data from the classical side to the quantum side and back?**

A hell lot. A crazy amount.
